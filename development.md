For details on the next phase (**Phase 3: Basic Agent Loop & LLM Integration**), please refer to the `project.md` document. The upcoming phase will focus on implementing:

- AgentController basics and history management
- LLMClient for interacting with language models
- Tokenizer for estimating token counts
- Basic one-step action execution via LLM

## LLM Considerations for Future Development

### Prompt Engineering

1. **Structured Output**: Ensure the system prompt clearly defines the expected JSON structure for actions. Include JSON schema examples directly in the prompts.

2. **Chunking Strategy**: The LLM needs explicit guidance on when to use the file chunking utilities. Include clear examples of reading large files chunk by chunk in the System Prompt.

3. **Error Recovery**: Include instructions in the prompt for how the LLM should handle failures and retry with different approaches.

### Context Window Management

1. **Summarization**: As history grows, implement a summarization strategy to condense older interactions while preserving important context.

2. **Metadata Over Content**: Encourage the LLM to store metadata about files (size, line count) rather than file contents when possible.

3. **Selective History**: Only include the most relevant history items in the context window, especially after the agent has been running for many iterations.

### Security Enhancement Ideas

1. **Command Sandboxing**: Consider implementing a sandbox for shell command execution to prevent damage to the system.

2. **Path Validation**: Add explicit path validation to prevent directory traversal attacks.

3. **Confirmation UI**: Enhance the confirmation mechanism with more detailed information about what each command will do.

## Feature Enhancements for Next Phases

### Phase 2 Improvements

1. **Action Validation**: Add schema validation for action JSON to prevent malformed actions.

2. **Deterministic Testing**: Create a more robust test framework for Action Executor with predictable mocked responses.

3. **Shell Command Safety**: Implement patterns to detect and prevent potentially harmful shell commands.

### Phase 3 Improvements

1. **Token Usage Tracking**: Add detailed token counting and reporting to optimize API usage.

2. **Streaming Responses**: Consider implementing streaming for LLM responses to improve user experience.

3. **History Compression**: Implement techniques to compress history items to maximize context window usage.

### Phase 4 Improvements

1. **Dynamic Prompts**: Create a mechanism to adjust prompts based on the specific task and context.

2. **Plan Validation**: Add validation for plans to ensure they're aligned with the task goals.

3. **Execution Monitoring**: Implement more sophisticated tracking of the agent's progress towards the goal.

### Phase 5 Improvements

1. **Content-Aware Chunking**: Enhance file chunking to be aware of content structure (e.g., code blocks, function boundaries).

2. **Advanced Summarization**: Use the LLM itself to generate better summaries of previous interactions.

3. **Interactive File Selection**: Add a UI component for the user to help the agent select relevant files.

### Additional Ideas

1. **Web Browsing Capability**: Add the ability for the agent to search the web for information.

2. **Local Tool Integration**: Allow the agent to use locally installed tools and applications.

3. **Visual Feedback**: Add a progress visualization to show the agent's state and thought process.

4. **Multi-Session Support**: Enable saving and resuming agent sessions.

5. **Collaborative Mode**: Allow multiple users to interact with the same agent session.

## Phase 3 Implementation: Basic Agent Loop & LLM Integration (NEARLY COMPLETE)

Based on the completion of Phases 1 and 2, we are now moving to Phase 3 which focuses on implementing the basic agent loop and LLM integration. This phase will provide the foundation for the AI-driven planning and execution cycle.

### Components to Implement

1. **AgentController** (`src/core/AgentController.ts`)

   - **History Management**

     - Implement conversation history tracking with distinct types for plans, actions, and observations
     - Create methods for adding to history and retrieving history items
     - Add support for history truncation to manage context size

   - **Basic Loop Structure**
     - Implement the main agent loop with iteration tracking
     - Add termination conditions (max iterations, goal completion)
     - Create state management for tracking current subtasks
     - Build error handling and recovery mechanisms

2. **LLM Client** (`src/llm/LLMClient.ts`)

   - **Core Functionality**

     - Create abstract base class for LLM interactions
     - Implement authentication and API key management
     - Add prompt sending functionality with rate limiting
     - Build response parsing and error handling

   - **Provider Implementation**
     - Implement specific provider (e.g., OpenAI) in `src/llm/providers/OpenaiClient.ts`
     - Add provider-specific authentication and API calls
     - Create provider-specific response formatting

3. **Tokenizer** (`src/llm/Tokenizer.ts`)

   - Implement token counting functionality based on LLM model
   - Add methods for estimating prompt token usage
   - Create utilities for context window management

   - Implement single-step execution flow (without planning yet)
   - Create mockable interfaces for testing
   - Add basic JSON parsing for LLM responses

### Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**

   - **LLMClient Tests**

   - Verify proper interfaces between components
   - Test error propagation through the system

### Acceptance Criteria

- `LLMClient` can send prompts with proper authentication (verified with mocked API)
- `Tokenizer` accurately estimates token usage for prompts
