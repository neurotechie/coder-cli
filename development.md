## Next Steps

**Phase 2** of the implementation is now complete. The Action Execution Engine has been successfully implemented and tested. The project now has the capability to execute shell commands, perform file operations, and handle task completion with a robust action execution system.

For details on the next phase (**Phase 3: Basic Agent Loop & LLM Integration**), please refer to the `project.md` document. The upcoming phase will focus on implementing:

- AgentController basics and history management
- LLMClient for interacting with language models
- Tokenizer for estimating token counts
- Basic one-step action execution via LLM

## LLM Considerations for Future Development

### Prompt Engineering

1. **Structured Output**: Ensure the system prompt clearly defines the expected JSON structure for actions. Include JSON schema examples directly in the prompts.

2. **Chunking Strategy**: The LLM needs explicit guidance on when to use the file chunking utilities. Include clear examples of reading large files chunk by chunk in the System Prompt.

3. **Error Recovery**: Include instructions in the prompt for how the LLM should handle failures and retry with different approaches.

### Context Window Management

1. **Summarization**: As history grows, implement a summarization strategy to condense older interactions while preserving important context.

2. **Metadata Over Content**: Encourage the LLM to store metadata about files (size, line count) rather than file contents when possible.

3. **Selective History**: Only include the most relevant history items in the context window, especially after the agent has been running for many iterations.

### Security Enhancement Ideas

1. **Command Sandboxing**: Consider implementing a sandbox for shell command execution to prevent damage to the system.

2. **Path Validation**: Add explicit path validation to prevent directory traversal attacks.

3. **Confirmation UI**: Enhance the confirmation mechanism with more detailed information about what each command will do.

## Feature Enhancements for Next Phases

### Phase 2 Improvements

1. **Action Validation**: Add schema validation for action JSON to prevent malformed actions.

2. **Deterministic Testing**: Create a more robust test framework for Action Executor with predictable mocked responses.

3. **Shell Command Safety**: Implement patterns to detect and prevent potentially harmful shell commands.

### Phase 3 Improvements

1. **Token Usage Tracking**: Add detailed token counting and reporting to optimize API usage.

2. **Streaming Responses**: Consider implementing streaming for LLM responses to improve user experience.

3. **History Compression**: Implement techniques to compress history items to maximize context window usage.

### Phase 4 Improvements

1. **Dynamic Prompts**: Create a mechanism to adjust prompts based on the specific task and context.

2. **Plan Validation**: Add validation for plans to ensure they're aligned with the task goals.

3. **Execution Monitoring**: Implement more sophisticated tracking of the agent's progress towards the goal.

### Phase 5 Improvements

1. **Content-Aware Chunking**: Enhance file chunking to be aware of content structure (e.g., code blocks, function boundaries).

2. **Advanced Summarization**: Use the LLM itself to generate better summaries of previous interactions.

3. **Interactive File Selection**: Add a UI component for the user to help the agent select relevant files.

### Additional Ideas

1. **Web Browsing Capability**: Add the ability for the agent to search the web for information.

2. **Local Tool Integration**: Allow the agent to use locally installed tools and applications.

3. **Visual Feedback**: Add a progress visualization to show the agent's state and thought process.

4. **Multi-Session Support**: Enable saving and resuming agent sessions.

5. **Collaborative Mode**: Allow multiple users to interact with the same agent session.
