## Phase 1 Implementation: Project Foundation & Core Utilities (COMPLETED)

### Completed Components

1. **Project Structure**

   - Set up TypeScript configuration
   - Created directory structure following the project specification
   - Configured Jest for testing

2. **Core Utilities**

   - **Configuration Module** (`config/index.ts`)

     - Implemented environment variable loading with dotenv
     - Created configuration interface with defaults
     - Added support for CLI argument overrides

   - **Logger Utility** (`src/utils/logger.ts`)

     - Implemented color-coded console output for different message types
     - Standardized log prefixes: [Task], [Plan], [Action], [Observation], [System], [Error]
     - Created a singleton instance for global access

   - **Rate Limiter** (`src/utils/RateLimiter.ts`)

     - Implemented exponential backoff with jitter
     - Created retry mechanism with configurable parameters
     - Added error handling and logging

   - **CLI Interface** (`src/cli.ts`)
     - Set up command-line argument parsing with Commander
     - Implemented configuration loading from CLI args
     - Added basic validation and error handling

3. **Testing**
   - Created unit tests for all core utilities
   - Set up Jest configuration for TypeScript testing
   - Implemented test mocks for external dependencies
   - Fixed test timeout issues in RateLimiter tests
   - Improved CLI test mocking for better reliability

### Recent Test Improvements

1. **RateLimiter Test Fixes**
   - Resolved timeout issues by properly mocking the sleep function
   - Improved deterministic testing by removing reliance on timer behaviors
   - Added better error handling in test cases
   - Silenced console output during tests to reduce noise
2. **CLI Test Fixes**
   - Implemented proper mocking with Jest's isolateModules
   - Fixed mock connection issues for Commander objects
   - Improved test structure with better assertions
   - Enhanced test reliability by avoiding timing issues

### Running the Project

To run the project after setup:

1. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file by copying `.env.sample` and filling in your API keys

3. Build the TypeScript project:

   ```
   npm run build
   ```

4. Run the CLI:

   ```
   npm start -- "Your task description here"
   ```

5. Run tests:
   ```
   npm test
   ```

## Next Steps

**Phase 1** of the implementation is now complete. All core utilities and foundation components have been implemented and tested successfully. The project now has a solid base to build upon for future phases.

For details on the next phase (**Phase 2: Action Execution Engine**), please refer to the `project.md` document. The upcoming phase will focus on implementing:

- Action Executor
- Core actions (shell, basic file system operations, finish)
- Unit tests for actions with mocked dependencies
- Action validation and error handling

## LLM Considerations for Future Development

### Prompt Engineering

1. **Structured Output**: Ensure the system prompt clearly defines the expected JSON structure for actions. Include JSON schema examples directly in the prompts.

2. **Chunking Strategy**: The LLM needs explicit guidance on when to use the file chunking utilities. Include clear examples of reading large files chunk by chunk in the System Prompt.

3. **Error Recovery**: Include instructions in the prompt for how the LLM should handle failures and retry with different approaches.

### Context Window Management

1. **Summarization**: As history grows, implement a summarization strategy to condense older interactions while preserving important context.

2. **Metadata Over Content**: Encourage the LLM to store metadata about files (size, line count) rather than file contents when possible.

3. **Selective History**: Only include the most relevant history items in the context window, especially after the agent has been running for many iterations.

### Security Enhancement Ideas

1. **Command Sandboxing**: Consider implementing a sandbox for shell command execution to prevent damage to the system.

2. **Path Validation**: Add explicit path validation to prevent directory traversal attacks.

3. **Confirmation UI**: Enhance the confirmation mechanism with more detailed information about what each command will do.

## Feature Enhancements for Next Phases

### Phase 2 Improvements

1. **Action Validation**: Add schema validation for action JSON to prevent malformed actions.

2. **Deterministic Testing**: Create a more robust test framework for Action Executor with predictable mocked responses.

3. **Shell Command Safety**: Implement patterns to detect and prevent potentially harmful shell commands.

### Phase 3 Improvements

1. **Token Usage Tracking**: Add detailed token counting and reporting to optimize API usage.

2. **Streaming Responses**: Consider implementing streaming for LLM responses to improve user experience.

3. **History Compression**: Implement techniques to compress history items to maximize context window usage.

### Phase 4 Improvements

1. **Dynamic Prompts**: Create a mechanism to adjust prompts based on the specific task and context.

2. **Plan Validation**: Add validation for plans to ensure they're aligned with the task goals.

3. **Execution Monitoring**: Implement more sophisticated tracking of the agent's progress towards the goal.

### Phase 5 Improvements

1. **Content-Aware Chunking**: Enhance file chunking to be aware of content structure (e.g., code blocks, function boundaries).

2. **Advanced Summarization**: Use the LLM itself to generate better summaries of previous interactions.

3. **Interactive File Selection**: Add a UI component for the user to help the agent select relevant files.

### Additional Ideas

1. **Web Browsing Capability**: Add the ability for the agent to search the web for information.

2. **Local Tool Integration**: Allow the agent to use locally installed tools and applications.

3. **Visual Feedback**: Add a progress visualization to show the agent's state and thought process.

4. **Multi-Session Support**: Enable saving and resuming agent sessions.

5. **Collaborative Mode**: Allow multiple users to interact with the same agent session.
